# Portfolio
This is the code to my website I'm using as my Coding Eportfolio. 
The website will containe information on what I have learnt to 
code as well as what I'm planning to do next. It will show the 
progress I have made when it comes to developing my coding.
The first thing I did was learn simple java.
